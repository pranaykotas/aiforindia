## AI Sovereignty

### Kailash Nadh on AI Sovereignty
[Article](https://nadh.in/blog/deepseek-ai-sovereignty-india/)

Some of his key observations:
> Freely accessible AI models along with the vast ecosystem of open-source tooling around them have become commodities. Meanwhile, ==large AI companies continue to burn massive amounts of cash offering AI software-as-a-service with no pathways to profitability== in sight, thanks to intense competition and the relentless race toward commoditisation. Where does India’s idea of AI sovereignty fit in?

> in India’s national perspective, ==does anchoring the idea of AI sovereignty on GPUs and foundation models matter? GPUs are a means to an end tied to specific architectures that are in vogue right now. Today’s LLMs are milestones in a decades-long R&D trajectory; tomorrow’s models will likely rely on entirely different architectures.== Is AI sovereignty then about developing a generative model with national interests baked in? Or is it about government-backed GPU clusters for industry? ==If foundation-level open-source models of ever-increasing efficacy are freely available, is model creation even a sovereign priority?== Could such attempts anywhere keep up with co-operative, global, open-source innovation?

> ==Consumption and usage of these technologies do not require a strategy, and production and breakthroughs in the open-source AI world will continue unabated irrespective of sovereign policies or goals.==

#### Comments 
1. Open weight is not the same as open source. LLM backdoors have been shown to be effective. How do sovereign countries establish model reliability for mission-critical purposes? See for example, papers such as https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07778. Sovereignty will require domestic capabilities for model evaluation before deployment in certain domains.
2. As AI is recognized to be a strategic technologies, the walls will start to go up. Kailash's point about "will continue unabated" may not hold, as countries put pressure on their companies to pursue strategic national interests and withhold technology from competitors. (US already has sanctions on hardware; not sure if the arxiv.org publication culture in AI will survive restrictions)
3. Kailash's point about long-term focus on domestic R&D capability is fair; however, from a national interest perspective, preserving and enhancing access to LLM technologies in the short and medium term needs to be addressed.
4. Kailash claims that ==major breakthroughs increasingly emerge from open-source development==. That claim is not really supported by facts (even if we ignore the fact that open weights is not open source or open data). DeepSeek was a breakthrough in reducing cost but wasn't a breakthrough in capabilities. I don't think there is any other _breakthrough_ that that is open weights, let alone a trend of _"increasingly"_. Open source models are mostly just trying to catch up to the frontier models.
