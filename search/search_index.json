Meanwhile, large AI companies continue to burn massive amounts of cash offering AI software-as-a-service with no pathways to profitability in sight, thanks to intense competition and the relentless race toward commoditisation. Where does India\u2019s idea of AI sovereignty fit in?</p> <p>in India\u2019s national perspective, does anchoring the idea of AI sovereignty on GPUs and foundation models matter? GPUs are a means to an end tied to specific architectures that are in vogue right now. Today\u2019s LLMs are milestones in a decades-long R&amp;D trajectory; tomorrow\u2019s models will likely rely on entirely different architectures. Is AI sovereignty then about developing a generative model with national interests baked in? Or is it about government-backed GPU clusters for industry? If foundation-level open-source models of ever-increasing efficacy are freely available, is model creation even a sovereign priority? Could such attempts anywhere keep up with co-operative, global, open-source innovation?</p> <p>Consumption and usage of these technologies do not require a strategy, and production and breakthroughs in the open-source AI world will continue unabated irrespective of sovereign policies or goals.</p>"},{"location":"geopolitics/#comments","title":"Comments","text":"<ol> <li>Open weight is not the same as open source.

That claim is not really supported by facts (even if we ignore the fact that open weights is not open source or open data). DeepSeek was a breakthrough in reducing cost but wasn't a breakthrough in capabilities. I don't think there is any other breakthrough that that is open weights, let alone a trend of \"increasingly\".
